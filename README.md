## Installation
The libraries employed in this project to run the code are Anaconda distribution of Python 3.*, Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Pytorch, PIL and json. If you have a lower python version, you can consider an upgrade using pip or conda.

## Project Motivation
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers. Imagine using something like this in a phone app that could tell the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, the trained classifier will then be exported for use as an application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

After the project completion, we'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. Finally, the project will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. 

## File Descriptions
The files associated with this work include
* The jupyter ipython notebook 
* The html file generated from the jupyter ipython notebook
* The training python file and the predict python file with which this application can be run as a command line application
## Results
An application which outputs the name of a flower image fed into it is produces. Checkout the files [here.](https://github.com/A-Nuru/Image-Classifier)
